# Analysis for the publication: Developmental consequences of defective ATG7-mediated autophagy in humans

This repository contains the RNA-seq analysis for the publication: *[Developmental consequences of defective ATG7-mediated autophagy in humans](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1915722)*

The raw scripts to perform the aberrant expression ([OUTRIDER](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/OUTRIDER.html) & [DESeq2](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DESeq2.html)) and aberrant splicing ([dasper](https://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/html/dasper.html#archives)) analysis sit in [scripts](scripts). 

The [index.Rmd](index.Rmd) contains some background, methods and code for tidying the raw outputs and generating figures/tables. This can be viewed as a .html via GitHub pages: https://dzhang32.github.io/ATG7_RNAseq
